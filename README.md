# Startng-HTML-task1
I made use of HTML in this project. It is more about practicing the use of headers e.g, h1-h4 as used in the codes,
also the use of the paragraph tag-&lt;p> breaktag - <br>
and I used the<pre></pre> tag to indent the text under heading 4
The task is majoryly about creating my first webpage by replicating a given task via coding with HTML.
